# Weather App using React

This is a simple Weather App built using React that fetches weather data from a weather API and displays it to the user.

## Features

- View current weather conditions based on searched location.
- Display temperature, humidity, feelslike, and other relevant weather data.
- Responsive design to provide a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) - Replace this with the API you're using.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
